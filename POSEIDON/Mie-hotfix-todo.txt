0. Remake aerosol grid on HAL 
- Normal one (68 species)                                                                     - DONE
- Directional (144 species, need to get files names made first to match supported_species.py) - DONE
- Diamonds (7 species)                                                                        - DONE
1. Make lognormal logwidth a free param option (test w/ SiO2 grid)                            - DONE
2. Fix load aerosol grid to work with and without 1                                           - DONE
3. Allow Mie_cloud_free() to be miepython instead of LX-MIE                                   - DONE
4. Have LX-Mie and miepython versions be seperate (with same functionalities and saving schemes) - DONE
