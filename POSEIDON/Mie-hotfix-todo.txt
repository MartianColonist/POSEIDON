0. Remake aerosol grid on HAL 
- Normal one (68 species)                                                                     - DONE
- Directional (144 species, need to get files names made first to match supported_species.py) - DONE
- Diamonds (7 species)                                                                        - DONE
1. Make lognormal logwidth a free param option (test w/ SiO2 grid)                            - DONE
2. Fix load aerosol grid to work with and without 1                                           - DONE
3. Allow Mie_cloud_free() to be miepython instead of LX-MIE
4. Have LX-Mie and miepython versions be seperate (with same functionalities and saving schemes)


X. Fix all utility functions in clouds.py 
X. Clean up core.py if-statements 
- To clouds.py                                                                                 -DONE
- To emission.py 
X. Fix shared array error 
X. Make aerosol_Mie_properties and precomputed_Mie_properties folders
   if they don't exist in precompute functions
X. Add to tutorial for multiple core production of precomputed properties
X. Make new figures for website (of aerosol properties on opacity database)
X. Update the txt file with new DOCDD links

X. Add patchy 2D clouds                                                                        - DONE
X  Add overlapping clouds                                                                      - DONE
X. Benchmark toon functions with picaso

BENCHMARKING WITH IZZY
1. Clear atmosphere, thermal emission and reflection 
2. MgSiO3 cloud, thermal emission and reflection 
3. Overlapping clouds (Fe and MgSiO3)

Updated clouds.py with new miepython precomputation algorithm, make-database, load-database, and interpolate-database
Integrated free log_r_m_std_dev into Mie_cloud and found it works with compute_spectrum 
-> Unfortunately, had to name the parameter log_rm_std_dev
-> Not sure if it works with multiple aerosols. 
-> Need to make a realistic grid range, and test error messages. 
Started to remake Normal aerosol database on Hal 
Got the directional and diamond indices renamed.
-> Will need to make sure they're edited for the algorithm.

Clean up core.py Mie statements and moved them to clouds.py
