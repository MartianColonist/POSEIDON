- Directional (144 species, need to get files names made first to match supported_species.py) - DONE
- Diamonds (7 species)                                                                        - DONE
1. Make lognormal logwidth a free param option (test w/ SiO2 grid)                            - DONE
2. Fix load aerosol grid to work with and without 1                                           - DONE
3. Allow Mie_cloud_free() to be miepython instead of LX-MIE                                   - DONE
4. Have LX-Mie and miepython versions be seperate (with same functionalities and saving schemes) - DONE


X. Fix all utility functions in clouds.py 
- Rerun all notebooks with scattering and reflection and clouds

X. Clean up core.py if-statements 
- To clouds.py                                                                                 -DONE
- To emission.py                                                                               - Just clean this up for surfaces

X. Fix shared array error 

X. Make aerosol_Mie_properties and precomputed_Mie_properties folders                          -DONE
   if they don't exist in precompute functions
X. Add to tutorial for multiple core production of precomputed properties                      -DONE
X. Make new figures for website (of aerosol properties on opacity database)                    -DONE
X. Update the txt file with new DOCDD links                                                    -DONE

X. Add patchy 2D clouds                                                                        - DONE
X  Add overlapping clouds                                                                      - DONE

X. Benchmark toon functions with picaso

X. Fix contributions.py 
- Add error messages so users don't try patchy clouds                                          - DONE
- Fix so spectral and pressure work with overlapping clouds (and total clouds = True)
  Pray to the dark gods that this is the only thing I need to do lol 
X. Import Ryan C's changes to toon functions that save memory 
X. Make sure 2D patchy clouds work with single stream emission and transmission                - Added an error if a user tries to use patchy clouds in emission, and also 2D patchy clouds in transmission.

X. Go ahead and add directionality cloud models                                                - DONE

X. Add diamond database

Website Fixes
- Upload new pngs 
- Make extra page for diamonds and directional aerosol tabulations 
- Fix links in opacity for new DOCCD (just change www to www2)
