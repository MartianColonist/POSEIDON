# # Atmospheric Retrievals with POSEIDON
# 
# At long last, your proposal to observe the newly discovered hot Jupiter WASP-999b with the *Hubble Space Telescope* has been accepted. Congratulations! 
# 
# ### Loading Data
# 
# Months later, after carefully reducing the observations, you are ready to gaze in awe at your transmission spectrum.
# 
# First, you load all the usual stellar and planetary properties for this system.

# ### Creating a Retrieval Model
# 
# Now comes the creative part: what model do you try first to fit WASP-999b's transmission spectrum?
# 
# Given the a priori known low density of the planet, you conclude it is reasonable to assume this is a giant planet dominated by $\rm{H}_2$ and $\rm{He}$. Looking at your data above, especially the **huge** absorption feature in the infrared around 1.4 Î¼m, you guess that $\rm{H}_2 \rm{O}$ could be present (based on theoretical predictions or after looking up its cross section).
# 
# So for a first attempt, you consider a model with $\rm{H}_2 \rm{O}$, an isothermal temperature profile, and no clouds.

# ### Setting Retrieval Priors
# 
# One of the most important aspects in any Bayesian analysis is deciding what priors to use for the free parameters. Specifying a prior has two steps: (i) choosing the type of probability distribution; and (ii) choosing the allowable range.
# 
# Most free parameters in atmospheric retrievals with POSEIDON use the following prior types:
# 
# - Uniform: you provide the minimum and maximum values for the parameter.
# - Gaussian: you provide the mean and standard deviation for the parameter.
# 
# <div class="alert alert-info">
# 
#   **Note:**
# 
#   If you do not specify a prior type or range for a given parameter, POSEIDON will ascribe a default prior type (generally uniform) and a 'generous' range.
# 
# </div>
# 
# **Priors for WASP-999b**
# 
# Your first retrieval is defined by three free parameters: (1) the isothermal atmospheric temperature; (2) the radius at the (fixed) reference pressure; and (3) the log-mixing ratio of $\rm{H}_2 \rm{O}$. Since you don't have any *a priori* information on WASP-999b's atmosphere, you decide to use uniform priors for the three parameters. 
# 
# You think a reasonable prior range for the temperature of this hot Jupiter is $400 \, \rm{K}$ to $(T_{\rm{eq}} + 200 \, \rm{K}) = 1600 \, \rm{K}$. For the reference radius, you choose a wide range from 85\% to 115% of the observed white light radius. Finally, for the $\rm{H}_2 \rm{O}$ abundance you ascribe a very broad range from $10^{-12}$ to 0.1.

# ### Pre-load Opacities
# 
# The last step before running a retrieval is to pre-interpolate the cross sections for our model and store them in memory. For more details on this process, see the forward model tutorial.
# 
# <div class="alert alert-warning">
# 
#   **Warning:**
# 
#   Ensure the range of $T_{\rm{fine}}$ used for opacity pre-interpolation is at least as large as the desired prior range for temperatures to be explored in the retrieval. Any models with layer temperatures falling outside the range of $T_{\rm{fine}}$ will be automatically rejected (for retrievals with non-isothermal P-T profiles, this prevents unphysical profiles with negative temperatures etc.)
#

from POSEIDON.core import read_opacities
import numpy as np

#***** Read opacity data *****#

opacity_treatment = 'opacity_sampling'

# Define fine temperature grid (K)
T_fine_min = 500     # 400 K lower limit suffices for a typical hot Jupiter
T_fine_max = 3000    # 2000 K upper limit suffices for a typical hot Jupiter
T_fine_step = 20     # 20 K steps are a good tradeoff between accuracy and RAM

T_fine = np.arange(T_fine_min, (T_fine_max + T_fine_step), T_fine_step)

# Define fine pressure grid (log10(P/bar))
log_P_fine_min = -6.0   # 1 ubar is the lowest pressure in the opacity database
log_P_fine_max = 2.5    # 100 bar is the highest pressure in the opacity database
log_P_fine_step = 0.2   # 0.2 dex steps are a good tradeoff between accuracy and RAM

log_P_fine = np.arange(log_P_fine_min, (log_P_fine_max + log_P_fine_step),
                    log_P_fine_step)

# Now we can pre-interpolate the sampled opacities (may take up to a minute)
opac = read_opacities(model, wl, opacity_treatment, T_fine, log_P_fine)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Run Retrieval
# 
# You are now ready to run your first atmospheric retrieval!
# 
# Here we will use the nested sampling algorithm MultiNest to explore the parameter space. The key input quantity you need to provide to MultiNest is called the *number of live points*, $N_{\rm{live}}$, which determines how finely the parameter space will be sampled (and hence the number of computed spectra). For exploratory retrievals, $N_{\rm{live}} = 400$ usually suffices. For publication-quality results, $N_{\rm{live}} = 2000$ is reasonable. 
# 
# This high_resolutional POSEIDON retrieval should take about 3.3 hours on 24 core.
# 
# <div class="alert alert-info">
# 
#   **Tip:**
# 
#   Retrievals run faster on multiple cores. When running the cells in this Jupyter notebook, only a single core will be used. You can run a multi-core retrieval on 4 cores by converting this Jupyter notebook into a python script, then calling mpirun on the .py file:
# 
#   ```
#   mpirun -n 24 python -u YOUR_RETRIEVAL_SCRIPT.py
