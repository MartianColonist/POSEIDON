**A Python Package for Multidimensional Atmospheric Retrievals of Exoplanet Spectra**

POSEIDON is a spectral modelling and atmospheric retrieval code for exoplanets.
Given a set of observed exoplanet spectra from space-based or ground-based telescopes, 
POSEIDON uses Bayesian techniques to infer the atmospheric properties of the planet.

Documentation
