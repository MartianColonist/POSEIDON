POSEIDON V1.2 Base Aerosol Database README 
Author: Elijah Mullens (eem85@cornell.edu)
Date : 8/12/2024

Thanks to Hannah Wakeford, Daniel Kitzmann, Elspeth Lee, Ben Burningham, Mark Marley, and Sarah Moran for help putting this together (Thanks y'all!).

This readme corresponds to Table 1 in Mullens et al. 2024
'Implementation of Aerosol Mie Scattering in POSEIDON with Application to the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b's Transmission, Emission, and Reflected Light Spectrum'

Refractive Indices for POSEIDON are found under the 'refractive_indices_txt_files' folder. Each txt file is split up into folders depending on which database they originate from. There is a separate folder where each txt file has their name exactly as it appears in POSEIDON supported_species.py. 

Images showing the precomputed aerosol properties, as well as the refractive indices from 0.2 to 30 um are shown in the aerosol_database.pdf and also the png previews in the opacity database tab in POSEIDON's readthedocs.

Please, please, please double check things if you end up using a reference! 

Sorry in advance for any typos

The refractive indices used to compute the radiative properties of the aerosols in Table 1 of Mullens et al. 2024 were compiled from 5 databases.

Wakeford & Sing (2015) - WS15

ADS   : https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...573A.122W/abstract
Table : 1

Wakeford and Sing (2015) compiled aerosol refractive indices for aerosols predicted to form in the upper atmospheres of hot Jupiters. Their philosophy was to never interpolate or extrapolate indices, and stuck to lab data. Wakeford & Sing (2015) utilized both plot digitizers and tables.

Some refractive indices were updated for the follow-up paper:

Table  : 1

Kitzmann & Heng (2018) compiled aerosol refractive indices for aerosols expected to form in extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs. Their philosophy was to utilize the Kramers-Kronig relation to recover missing real and imaginary indices from datasets. Kitzmann & Heng (2018) utilized both a plot digitizer and tables.

Additionally, when an aerosol is considered to be anisotropic, they would weigh the dielectric functions in each direction by 1/3 and convert them to refractive indices.

Compiled aerosols for retrievals of brown dwarf 2M224-0158. Note that the refractive indices have been interpolated to match the wavelength grid found in the EGP Mie code (which means that all these entries have the same wavelength grid from 0.268 to 227.5 um). 

Sometimes, this means that things are interpolated to shorter to longer wavelengths to fit the grid, which we will note below.

There are four common sources of refractive indices that are useful tools to find data from.

---------------------------------
Handbook of Optical Constants of Solids
Edited by Edward D. Palik 

There are three versions of this book: 

Volume 1 : 1985
ADS      : https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985hocs.book.....P/abstract

Volume 2 : 1991 
ADS      : https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991hocs.book.....P/abstract

Volume 3 : 1998
ADS      : N/A

This is a great resource to find refractive indices in. The book can usually be accessed through a university log-in from the following websites: 

https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780125444156/handbook-of-optical-constants-of-solids

https://app.knovel.com/kn/resources/kpHOCS000M/toc

In their 'Critiques' sections, Palik and co-authors compile refractive index from multiple lab sources. If a Palik entry is used, be sure to dig up the chapter in the textbook in order to see where the data comes from.

Note that their tables will often list the scientific notation for the first and last entry that has that same scientific notation (I.e. it will start with 1e-2 and end with 1e-2 and it is implied that every value between has a 1e-2 value).

Citations for Palik entries include the author of the specific section of the textbook, and Palik (i.e. Ribarsky in Palik (1985)).

#################################
Definitions and Concepts 
#################################

These are things I had to google a lot while making this.

---------------------------------
Refractive Indices 

Solids and liquids have their optical properties defined by wavelength-dependent refractive indices. Real refractive indices describe the scattering properties of an aerosol, while the imaginary describe the absorptive properties.
---------------------------------
Dielectric Function

The dielectric function is the square of the refractive index. Many lab papers will cite this.
---------------------------------
Wavenumber

The bane of all exoplanet scientists. Wavenumber is 1/cm. 
100 cm-1     = 100 um ~ 0.012 eV
1000 cm-1    = 10 um  ~ 0.12 eV
10000 cm-1   = 1 um   ~ 1.2 eV
100000 cm -1 = 0.1 um ~ 12 eV
---------------------------------
Kramers-Kronig Relation

In theory, the real and imaginary refractive indices are related through the Kramers-Kronig relation. Kitzmann and Heng 2018 utilize the Kramers-Kronig relation to fill in gaps where real or refractive indices were missing, and many lab papers will measure either the real or imaginary index and get the other through this relation. 

A good open source pipeline for this is pyElli

https://github.com/PyEllips/pyElli
---------------------------------
Lab Techniques 

There are a multitude of lab techniques utilized to measure the refractive constants/dielectric functions of aerosols. 

- Thin Film 

Aerosols are deposited on a thin film and then reflectance measurements are made. The thickness of the film is important to measure. From these measurements, one can derive the real refractive indices (and get the imaginary through Kramers-Kronig). It is also possible to get the transmittance through a film and derive imaginary refractive indices (and get the real through Kramers Kronig).

- Ellipsometry 

A technique for deriving refractive indices of thin films. Measures change in polarization of incident radiation due to reflection, absorption, scattering, or transmittance. 

- KBr pellet 

Ground powder of aerosols can be deposited on KBr pellets, which are optically transparent from 0.22 to 30 um. Transmittance is measured (how light is attenuated). Together with the powder density, one can derive imaginary refractive indices (and get the real through Kramers-Kronig).

- Natural Crystal

Crystals from Earth. Can perform both reflective and transmittance measurements. Crystals are usually cut and polished to find crystallographic axes easier. 

- Single Crystal

Crystals are grown in a lab (usually defined as a 'single crystal' or 'synthetic').

- Airborne 

Powders are suspended in a gas chamber where their optical properties are measured. 

---------------------------------
Amorphous vs Crystalline 

Amorphous solids have no crystal structure. This is usually due to being solidified too fast, or due to being organic in nature. Due to this, amorphous solids are isotropic and have little fine structure in their spectra. Additionally amorphous features are less sensitive to temperature than crystalline.

Glasses are a special kind of amorphous solid where the liquid/molten properties are 'frozen' in. (Think why glass is see-through is because it is molten sand that was frozen in a liquid configuration). All glasses are amorphous, but not all amorphous are glasses. Glass is considered to be a supercooled, configurationally frozen liquid. Therefore, it has optical properties similar to its liquid/molten state. 

Sol-gel is a technique to make amorphous solids. (Involves an liquid solution that is mixed with solids to form a gel, after which the particles are removed and usually densified to remove porosity).

Crystalline solids do have crystal structure and therefore can be isotropic or anisotropic, and have fine structure in their spectra. 

---------------------------------
Crystal Systems and Directionality

There are seven main types of crystal systems. 

cubic, tetragonal, hexagonal, trigonal/rhombohedral, orthorhombic/rhombic, monoclinic, triclinic

Where sometimes trigonal/rhomohedral is considered a subset of hexagonal 

Cubic systems are isotropic 

Tetragonal, hexagonal, and trigonal/rhombohedral crystals are anisotropic and usually uniaxial, meaning that they only have one optical axis. 

Optical properties are defined as polarizations of light parallel to the c-axis (extraordinary, E||c) and polarizations perpendicular to the c-axis (ordinary, E⟂c).

Orthorhombic/rhombic, monoclinic, and triclinic are anisotropic and usually biaxial, meaning that they have two optical axes.

Optical properties are defined as polarizations of light parallel to the a-axis, b-axis, and c-axis (E||a, E||b, and E||c)

When a specific direction is used for a non-cubic crystal, it will be noted below. 
When directions are averaged, it will be noted below.
(Note that the ordinary index gets a 2/3 weighting and the extraordinary a 1/3 weighting for uniaxial materials) 

There are exceptions to the rules above, which will be noted below.
---------------------------------
Equilibrium vs Disequilibrium Cloud Formation 

Parmentier (2016), section 2.3 gives a great summary of equilibrium vs disequilibrium cloud formation in section. We will refer to both in the sections below.

https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...828...22P/abstract#:~:text=We%20suggest%20that%20a%20transition,T%20transition%20on%20brown%20dwarfs.

'In the equilibrium cloud approach it is assumed that the change of the physical properties of a parcel of gas advected around the planet is slow compared to the condensation timescale. When a parcel of gas is transported from a hot to a cold part of the atmosphere, the most refractory condensates, such as MgSiO3, form first, depleting the gas in cloud-forming elements such as Si. When the temperature drops low enough, more volatile compounds, such as SiO2, are unable to form since the surrounding gas is depleted in Si (e.g., Visscher et al. 2010). If the opposite is assumed, i.e., if the parcels of gas are supposed to move faster than the growing of the grains, then all condensates form at the same time, leading to a prevalence of more volatile compounds such as SiO2 (e.g., Helling et al. 2008).'

Visscher 2010 (Equilibrium)
https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/716/2/1060

Helling 2008 (Disequilibrium)
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008arXiv0809.3657H/abstract

Evidence for equilibrium cloud formation (from Visscher 2010): 

1. First, the presence of germane (GeH4) and the absence of silane (SiH4) in the upper atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn (even though Si is expected to be much more abundant than Ge) can be explained by the removal of Si from the gas into silicate clouds deeper in the atmosphere, whereas Ge remains in the gas phase

2. Second, the detection of H2S in Jupiter’s troposphere by the Galileo entry probe indicates that Fe must be sequestered into a cloud layer at deep atmospheric levels, because the formation of FeS would otherwise remove H2S from the gas above the ∼700 K level

3. Third, absorption from monatomic K gas in the spectra of T dwarfs (Burrows et al. 2000; Geballe et al. 2001) requires the removal of Al and Si at deeper atmospheric levels, because K would otherwise be removed from the observable atmosphere by the condensation of orthoclase (KAlSi3O8; Lodders & Fegley 2006). 

4. The presence of monatomic Na gas in brown dwarfs (Kirkpatrick et al. 1999; Burgasser et al. 2003; McLean et al. 2003; Cushing et al. 2005) also suggests Al and Si removal, because albite (NaAlSi3O8) condensation would otherwise effectively remove Na from the observable atmosphere.

5. Furthermore, the removal of Na by Na2S cloud formation is consistent with the observed weakening of Na atomic lines throughout the L dwarf spectral sequence and their disappearance in early T dwarfs

Evidence for disequilibrium cloud formation has come from observations of quartz (SiO2) in sub-stellar atmospheres (Burningham 2021, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210504268B/abstract, and Grant 2023, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...956L..32G/abstract)

---------------------------------
Particle size vs Refractive Indices 

The short wavelength, UVIS, radiative properties of aerosols mostly depends on particle size (weakly dependent on species) whereas absorption features depends on refractive indices (strongly dependent on species). 

Note that some species can have absorption features or non-linear scattering properties (good examples are C, MnS, etc) but that many species have scattering that depends mostly on particle size. 

For more information on on small-particle, medium-particle, and large-particle scattering and absorption theory, see the following textbooks:

We start with aerosols that are expected to form on super/ultra-Hot Jupiters.

These are condensates found in the M-L transition space. Specifically, Ca, Ti, and Al bearing species have been found to condense out. It is expected that hibonite, cordunum, and perovskite will condense out. These species are expected to deplete atmosphere of aluminum.

These are aerosols that are expected to form in temperatures similar to the atmospheres of M and L dwarfs. These aerosols are usually related to the condensation of Ti or V gas and serve as the 'seed' particles in many GCMs. (TiO and VO gas are very good UVIS absorbers and are though to cause thermal inversions, they can get condensed out and become cold-trapped or form lofted seed particles)

Took UVIS measurements of TiO2 thin film, see Figure 5 which matches the txt file. Goal was to test how well TiO2 was as a wire grid polarizer. Due to the thin film method utilized, the TiO2 in this sample has no directionality. Additionally, it doesn't mention that the sample is specifically anatase. 

--------------

Exoplanet/Brown Dwarf Papers:

TiO2 is important as a 'seed' particle that other aerosols can condense onto, and it is expected to condense out alongside CaTiO3 first in brown dwarfs.

Anatase is a low temperature, low pressure modification of TiO2. Anatase transforms into rutile via annealing at around T = 1200K.

Ribarsky in Palik (1985) compiled many different lab sources to tabulate the ordinary and extraordinary indices of rutile.

Zeidler (2011) measured the reflectance spectra of natural rutile (technically Ti[0.984]V[0.008]Fe[0.008]O[2]) to fill in gaps in Ribarsky in Palik (1985). They note that their natural rutile had water inclusions, which could cause extra OH modes around 3 um.

The indices for the rutile txt file are a mesh-mash of both references listed above. Specifically, Zeidler 2011 filled in a gap in imaginary indices from Ribarsky in Palik 1985 from 0.5 to 8 um region.

TiO2 is important as a 'seed' particle that other aerosols can condense onto, and it is expected to condense out alongside CaTiO3 first in brown dwarfs.

Rutile is most abundant form of TiO2 on Earth, and expected at hotter temperatures.

Selected four VO[2] thin film samples. Sample 2, insulating (measurements carried at 303.15K), was used to generate the txt file (Table in Section 6), which had a thickness of 130 nm on a Si+ native oxide substrate. 

VO[2] thin film sample was produced by sputtering V[2]O[5] material, which was then superheated to 973K to convert V[2]O[5] to VO[2].  

VO[2] is monoclinic (uniaxial) and insulating below 340K, and tetragonal (uniaxial) and metallic above. However, the thin film procedure ensured that the VO[2] was randomly oriented.

Exoplanet/Brown Dwarf Papers:

Equilibrium calculations have VO be the first V bearing species to condense, however VO[2] and V[2]O[5] are more common on Earth. The above VO[2] indices can be potentially used as a VO proxy.

Though there seems to be debates on whether VO condenses as VO around 1800K, or as a solid solution with Ti-bearing condensates. Also seems like VO can get cold-trapped in hot Jupiter atmospheres.

Iron is expected to condense out in a homogenous manner since the condensation temperature is around 1500-2300K (the Fe-deck). This is slightly proved by the existence of H2S in Jupiter's atmosphere (FeS would be dominate gas species, not H2S.

Collection of room temperature lab measurements of alpha iron (presumed alpha since measurements were taken at room temperature). Even though iron is cubic, alpha iron is ferromagnetic below 1040K, which makes it anisotropic. This effect is minimal unless there is an applied magnetic field. 

Iron has many allotropes. Normal pressures and high temperatures forms sigma iron (body centered cubic) at 1811K, which then forms gamma iron (face centered cubic) at 1667K, and then alpha iron below 1185K. High pressure iron forms epsilon and beta iron. 

Above 1040K, alpha iron is paramagnetic.

Note from KH18 Paper to keep in mind: 
‘For troilite we combine the two data sets of Pollack et al. (1994) and Henning & Mutschke (1997). The compilation of Pollack et al. (1994) used a few experimental data points in combination with extrapolations to account for the missing data. Especially in the infrared region, this set is not consistent with the measured data provided by Henning & Mutschke (1997). We therefore replace the IR data with the latter one and use the Kramers-Kronig relations to consistently combine the IR part with the measured shortwave data provided in Pollack et al. (1994). This leads to a shift of the strong iron feature near 3 µm to slightly larger wavelengths compared to the original compilation provided by Pollack et al. (1994).’

ISM paper looked at potential compositions of molecular cloud grains. FeS forms between H2S and Fe at 680K, independent of pressure. The txt file matches Figure 1 in the paper. 

Do note that the authors compile their FeS indices from many sources, that included experimental data and extrapolations (see their Appendix B5 and table for references). More specifically:

1. In the visible FeS displays quasi-metallic behavior and therefore they extrapolated the imaginary index down to 0.1 um and up to 3 um by scaling visible values by square root of lambda. (Egan & Hilgeman, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977Icar...30..413E/abstract) who measured a troillite sample from Del Norte County, California (U. S.

Paper Info : 

Looked at temperature dependent data of ISM aerosols (300, 200, 100, and 10K). Due to overlapping wavelengths with the other file, and KH18's use of Kramers-Kronig, I am unsure of which temperature was used, but probably the hottest one (300K). 

FeS was prepared by melting in an arc furnace and quenching. Samples were then cut from a silica tube. These processes is described in both Begemann (1994) and Begemann (1993) (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994ApJ...423L..71B/abstract, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993AGAb....9..164M/abstract) where Begemann (1994) has refractive indices for many Mg-Fe sulfides. 

Reflection measurements were made of FeS embedded into an epoxy resin and polished, transmission measurements were made by grounding FeS into small balls and embedding them in KBr and PE pellets. 

This paper is unclear on whether it is amorphous or crystalline, but Figure 1b has a lot of fine structure, which leads me to believe that it is crystalline.

#################################
Magnesium 
#################################

Magnesium silicates are very common in brown dwarf and exoplanet literature. They are expected to condense out above the Fe-deck assuming equilibrium cloud formation as forms of forsterite and enstatite. 

Magnesium is the assumed limiting element. Forsterite will form first, and then enstatite. Pyroxenes and olivine with iron inclusions can form if Fe isn't rained out. Assuming a solar Mg/Si abundance, Mg2SiO4 formation consumes nearly half of the total Si abundance because the solar elemental abundances of Mg and Si are approximately equal.

Alumina-magnesium species, like spinel, will only form if aluminum gas isn't depleted by condensation of aluminum oxides like corundum. 

Expected to form in observable layers of L-dwarfs. As brown dwarfs continue to cool to 1400K (T-dwarf), the clouds start to dissipate (patchy clouds) and sink to deeper in the atmosphere. 

Pyroxenes silicate series follow the equation  Mg[x]Fe[1-x]SiO3 with a Mg rich end-member (MgSiO[3], Enstatite) and a Fe rich end-member [FeSiO[3], Ferrosilite].

Olivines follow the equation Mg[2y]Fe[2-2y]SiO4 with a Mg rich end-member (Mg[2]SiO[4], Forsterite) and a Fe rich end-member [Fe[2]SiO[4], Fayalite]. Think 'Four' for Forsterite!

It is expected that silicates condense in a crystalline state at high temperatures and amorphous states at lower temperatures, where amorphous particles can transition to a crystalline state by being exposed to high temperatures for a set period of time (i.e. annealing). 

Therefore, it can be reasonable to predict that crystalline forms of silicates are present in hot Jupiters.

Thin films of amorphous magnesium silicates with compositions similar to enstatite and forsterite are deposited using excimer laser ablation of parent materials. Refractive indices are derived from optical transmission and reflection together with Kramers-Kronig analysis. Measured indices are reported for 0.12-17.5 um and extended to short and longer wavelengths by fitting data reported from other experiments and theoretical predictions. 

Sample for forsterite was made by 308 mm excimer laser ablation of geological, natural samples of polycrystalline forsterite.

Presents optical constants of pure, amorphous Mg-silicates. Used sol-gel, a chemical technique based on the condensation of Mg- and Si-hydroxides in a liquid phase (crystallize at lower temperatures for some reason). They use sol gel, remove Mg-Si particles, and then densify them to remove porosity. Amorphousness is determined via Xray. For an explanation, see section 2 of this paper.

Figure 5 shows a comparison of sol-gel and thin-films from Scott and Duley (1996), which was used to make amorphous Mg2SiO4 from B21. Also shows in Figure 9 what assuming an iron core to the sol-gel does to spectra.

It is expected that silicates condense in a crystalline state at high temperatures and amorphous states at lower temperatures, where amorphous particles can transition to a crystalline state by being exposed to high temperatures for a set period of time (i.e. annealing). 

Therefore, it can be reasonable to predict that crystalline forms of silicates are present in hot Jupiters.

Thin films of amorphous magnesium silicates with compositions similar to enstatite and forsterite are deposited using excimer laser ablation of parent materials. Refractive indices are derived from optical transmission and reflection together with Kramers-Kronig analysis. Measured indices are reported for 0.12-17.5 um and extended to short and longer wavelengths by fitting data reported from other experiments and theoretical predictions. 

Sample for enstatite was made by 308 mm excimer laser ablation of geological, natural samples of polycrystalline forsterite. 

Measured imaginary indices and used Kramers-Kronig to derive the real indices, and then iterated using a numerical procedure to obtain consistent sets of n and k.

The crystalline revolution OoO.

Mass absorption coefficients were derived from transmission spectra of small grains embedded in KBr and polyethylene pellets. Except in the case of enstatite. 

For enstatite, a natural monocrystalline samples was available. They found optical constants for each crystallographic direction. B21 took a mean over the three crystallographic directions. 

Because it was natural enstatite, they found inclusions of Al2O3 in the sample. They also note that this is ortho-enstatite, which is more common in nature (ortho refers to orthorhombic crystal shape). They also took measurements of synthetic clino-enstatite (monoclinic), which has similar spectra (only forms in extreme environments).

Also because it was natural they found the enstatite experienced weathering which forms talc on the surface that can induce new features.

Paper Info :

The original WS15 paper cited the DOCCD database as the source of the spinel indices. The website has undergone updates since 2015, however it looks like the indices are from the 'Natural and natural-thermal-processed Mg-spinels (crystalline) (Fabian et al. 2001)' entry, specifically the annealed at 1h, 1223K data, by comparing the plots there with Figure 1 in WS15. 

It is assumed that WS15 used a plot digitizer, since the txt file doesn't match any txt file on the website. 

Synthesized a variety of nonstoichiometric spinels, which are available on DOCCD, and investigated natural spinel before and after thermal annealing. 

The natural crystal is a dark red, octahedral crystal from Burma. Through EDX, found it was actually Mg[1.02]Al[1.93]Si[0.03]Fe[0.01]Cr[0.01]O[4]. The inclusions shouldn't affect the mid-IR spectra. 

Reflectance, mid-infrared spectra of all samples. Natural spinel was annealed at 1223K for one hour in order to induce a phase transition from ordered to disordered spinel.

Silicates 
#################################

Condensates with silicates (no magnesium) are not usually predicted by equilibrium cloud formation since Si is depleted through the formation of forsterite and enstatite.

From Visscher 2010 (Equilibrium cloud formation): 
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...716.1060V/abstract

'Mg2SiO4 formation consumes nearly half of the total Si abundance because the solar elemental abundances of Mg and Si are approximately equal. Thus, quartz (Tcond ∼ 1550 K) can only form in the absence of enstatite (Tcond ∼ 1600 K), because MgSiO3 otherwise efficiently removes silicon from the gas phase. We therefore conclude that SiO2 will not condense within the silicate cloud in equilibrium chemistry.'

More recently, it was found that SiO2 could condense in equilibrium cloud formation if an atmosphere has surpassed enstatite formation (subsolar Mg/Si abundances, Si abundance larger than Mg; Burningham 2021, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210504268B/abstract)

In the 'dirty dust grain' model where refractory-rich gas is circulated to the upper atmosphere and forms 'seed particles', which grow as the fall through the atmosphere, SiO2 is predicted to be the most abundance cloud species. See Figure 1 in Helling 2018 for a visual depiction.

Compute dielectric functions from first principle equations and lab data (sec 2.1), assuming a density of 3.22 g/cm-3.

1. At x-Ray wavelengths (hv > 12 eV, wavelengths less than 0.1 um), dielectric functions are estimated from atomic theory (not sure if this is the right word, but it's an equation)  (Equation 2-3)

2. For 4-10 eV (0.3 um to 0.123 um) from experimental data in Philipp & Taft (1969) (actually 1960, see below)

3. 10eV to 12eV was smoothly extrapolated

4. Infrared wavelengths were computed from contributions of N damped oscillators (equation 4) (single oscillator fit for SiC). Specifically, they take the oscillator fit from Bohren & Huffman (1983) (see below) and add continuum to align it with Pegourie (1998) (see below).

Paper Info :

Around S-stars with equal carbon and oxygen, it is expected that oxygen is locked up in SiO and CO. SiO can condense into solid SiO. Thin films of amorphous SiO were formed by SiO vapor deposition on a Si(111) wafer and the dielectric function was fit with a Brendel oscillator model from 2 to 100 um at 300K. Figure 3 shows the dielectric functions, real and imaginary. 

The real indices in the txt file match Figure 3, but the imaginary don't. I assume that the real indices were found by taking the square root of the real dielectric function, and the imaginary were derived with Kramers-Kronig analysis. Additionally, it looks like these filled in wavelengths from 14 to 100 um.

Note on wavelength coverage: 

The wavelength coverage from 0.15 to 6.66 um is sparse. In the aerosol database, the points from 0.15 to 3.45 to 6.66 is assumed to be linear. This isn't too much of an issue since 1. The real indices are mostly flat in this wavelength region, 2. The imaginary indices are very low (1e-5) (no major absorption) [See Palik indices below], and 3. Optical properties in this region are dominated mostly by particle size, not composition. 

The 3.45 um point is a bit of a mystery, but is assumed to just be an 'in-between' point between the two datasets.

Note: 

The original WS15 paper also cites Anderson 2006 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006JQSRT.100....4A/abstract), which utilized amorphous glass indices from Palik. Plotting up the WS15 against the Palik glass ones, they don't match, and its assumed that the txt file was updated later on.

Measured crystalline quartz, airborne particles (15 nm to 20 um) from infrared to UV. Used the airborne method since they did not like previous KBr pellet methods. Quartz sample comes from Sigma-Aldrich (CAS number 14808-60-7, particle size < 63 um) and has a density provided by the manufacturer of 2.65 g/cm3). Suspended in rotating N2 gas with a measured lognormal particle distribution centered around 0.24 um (width of 2.24). 

No need to separate extraordinary and ordinary rays since random orientation was checked with a polarizer.

NOTE: 

KH18 says they used Na2S and ZnS, but only cite a Na2S paper. It is assumed that the ZnS in Palik was used, since it has a feature before 30 microns. Additionally, while their imaginary indices match WS15's, their real indices do not. It is assumed that the imaginary indices were taken from Huffman & Wild and Montaner, and the real indices were derived using the Kramers-Kronig relation. Because of this, the scattering slope shape is different than the one in WS15.

In the Palik textbook, sometimes the imaginary index column is empty. When this happens, WS15 will take the value as constant until the next k-value is listed. This constant k causes a 'step-function-like' opacity in the database. 

There are two n and k columns in Palik. When a wavelength has two n values listed, the first two columns are the default. It is not clear to me what the difference between these columns are.

Paper Info :

The original paper was Zernike (1964) (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1964JOSA...54.1215Z/abstract), which had methods but an error in the tables that was fixed in the follow up Zernike (1965). 

Used a prism with triangular faces of ADP and measured extraordinary and ordinary directions at room temperature. 

I used Table 7, absolute (calibrated) indices in 1965 paper.

I assumed that the short wavelengths have a refractive index of 0 due to being in the transparent regime up to 1.15 um. From 1.15 to 2um, the indices are extrapolated (see Fig 1 in 1964). 

Edwards and White in Palik Vol 2, Section 49 speak on why KDP and ADP make good crystals for nonlinear optical devices and laser, and why assuming k = 0 in the shortest wavelength is a decent assumption. 

I weighted the extraordinary by ⅓ and ordinary by ⅔, assuming the crystal is symmetric on two of its axes (its crystal shape is a prism, much like quartz, except it optically negative which means it assumes an oblate spheroid shape).

I excluded 2 um here in lieu of the next dataset.

ADP crystal is piezoelectric, which means it can generate electric signals when stressed (neat!).

According to Dr. Howett, these indices are mentioned in her paper: 

Howett (2007)

ADS        : https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007JOSAB..24..126H/abstract

Paper Info :

NH4SH transitions from amorphous to crystalline at 160K. Annealing crystalline NH4SH results in absorption features becoming sharper and increasing in magnitude, with little change in wavelength position. 

The paper above mentions that there are a few unpublished NH4SH datasets floating around the planetary science community (set A and set B in Howett (2007)). 

Just comparing the txt file to Figure 10, my indices match set A better. I believe that set A and set B are mislabeled in this plot, and that set A is actually the polycrystalline set (set B), just by comparing the tables and the figures. 

Set B indices are supposedly based off the work of Ferraro (1980) (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980ApSpe..34..525F/abstract) where 0.5-2.6 um were extrapolated. 

While Carly Howett mentions an updated dataset in the paper, the website that hosted them has been taken down.

Paper Info :

Cubic phase (crystalline) of solid ammonia. Real indices were derived via Kramers-Kronig. Absorption coefficients used to determine the imaginary indices are from a variety of sources. 

1. Absorption coefficients from Sill et al. (1981) (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981JChPh..74..997S/abstract) form the bulk of the data set used to determine optical constants. 

Sill et al. (1981) used Fourier spectrometers in the 1.4 - 200 um range of an ammonia ice thin film sample at 88K. Absorption coefficients were obtained but no refractive indices were derived. 

2. UV wavelength mass absorption coefficients were taken from  77K Dressler & Schnepp (1960) (https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/33/1/270/207591/Absorption-Spectra-of-Solid-Methane-Ammonia-and?redirectedFrom=fulltext), and Browell & Anderson (1975) (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975JOSA...65..919B/abstract). 

Dressler & Schnepp (1960) took measurements of thin films created my ammonia vapor deposition at both 77K and 175K. Since ammonia ice undergoes a phase transition from amorphous to cubic from 70 to 90K, Martonchik (1984) assumes that the 77K substrate was cubic in phase and took the absorption coefficients at 77K, reduced by a factor of 4.0 (recalibration). 

Browell & Anderson (1975) recalibrated the absorption coefficients of Dressler & Schnepp (1960).

Paper Info :

Indices were generated from Table 1 and Table 2. Since the wavelengths for real and imaginary indices were not the same, the real and imaginary indices were interpolated onto a grid of shared wavelengths. 

Ice tholins were generated by 50 irradiations over a five month timeline of C2H6/H2O (ethane/water) ice (1:6 ratio) at 77K, which produced the ice tholins.  

Because it is a photochemical product, I assume it is amorphous.

Soots and Hazes
#################################

Soots and hazes are mostly photochemical products that can exist in planetary atmospheres. 

Technically, soots are a combustion product while hazes are photochemical (and usually organic)

These usually form in the upper atmosphere at temperatures less than 900K. (Sub-Neptunes, Venus-like planets, potentially the limb of Hot Jupiters).

The two papers above are a series that look at scattering of interstellar dust grains in the X-ray, Optical, and UV.

Lab data was originally compiled in Draine & Lee (1984) (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984ApJ...285...89D/abstract), which across the board compiled room temperature graphite crystal data. See section 2b for more details on how lab data was compiled for graphite. They were refined for Draine 2003 an and b.

Paper Info :

Exoplanet specific paper looking at the stability and optical properties of flame soots in Hot Jupiters. 

From the paper: 

'Among the compounds investigated, the material with the highest resistance to extreme temperatures is soot. 

Although this term encompasses a large family of combustion or pyrolysis products of carbon chemistry, all characteristic examples we found have the lowest rates of evaporation at high temperatures. 

Soot is a common product of high temperature chemistry, but its formation in a planetary atmosphere will depend on the availability of carbon species.'

They compiled many laboratory investigations of the refractive index of soot particles (see their Figure 9). They checked the consistency between real and imaginary indices of the refractive indices by using the Kramers-Kronig relation by 1) deriving the average n and k spectra from all the lab sources (solid lines in Figure 9) and 2) calculating the corresponding n and k from Kramers Kronig (dashed lines in Figure 9), which were consistent with the average spectra.

The txt file is compiled from the Kramers-Kronig data (dotted lines in Figure 9).

Here is a list of the lab sources they compiled:

The upper atmospheres (stratospheres) of solar system gas giants can have complex carbon chemistry (due to the photolysis of methane). 

While C2H2 (acetylene), C2H4 (ethene), and C2H6 (ethane) are expected to form initially from methane photolysis, as the photolyzed products 'rain' down they can grow more complex in structure (and potentially form complex hydrocarbons like hexene). 

Note that hexane is C6H14 while hexane is C6H12

Measurements made of 300K sulfuric acid solutions having different concentrations by weight ( 95.6, 84.5, 75, 50, 38, and 25%), with the other weight being water.

Used Kramers-Kronig analysis to obtain values of n and k from reflection measurements in the intermediate infrared (400 to 4000 1/cm).

I used the 84.5% columns of Table 1 and 2 since it had the most complete shortest wavelengths. 

I made the 0.702 to 0.360 imaginary indices were made with an exponential fit (scipy curve fit) since the table had no imaginary index data for those recorded real indices.

( made the 2.564 to 2.770 imaginary indices were made with exponential fit, and then offset down by 0.005 to fit the data (table had no imaginary index data for those recorded real indices).

Paper Info :

Orthorhombic sulfur (also known as octasulfur, or alpha-S), only has one stable molecule, which is cyclo-octasulfur (also known as lambda sulfur). From lambda sulfur, you get two different kind of crystal polymorphs: alpha-S (strongly anisotropic orthorhombic crystals) and beta-S (weakly anisotropic monoclinic crystals). Alpha-S is stable at room temperature and turns into beta-S above 368K.

Palik compiled many different sources and only records one polarization axis, specifically the polarizations along the an and b axes. They note that while orthorhombic crystals are usually biaxial, they average the an and b axes to make an effective 'ordinary ray'.

They find an imaginary index for the upper cloud layer of 5e-3. 
--------------

How I made the indices:

I followed the suggestions of Sromovsky (2019) (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020Icar..34413398S/abstract), Section 3.4.2.

I used a real index of 1.82 for all wavelengths, which corresponds to white phosphorus (P4), which has no near-IR features. This value is close to the value of diphosphine (P2H4) at 195K recorded by Wohlfarth (2008). [Wohlfarth is a textbook that just reports the real index of P2H4 at different temperatures using white light, is 1.74 at 195K].

I hen divide the imaginary indices of Noy (1981) by 10, as suggested, and anything past 0.6 um utilized the retrieved imaginary index 5e-3 from Fletcher (2023).
